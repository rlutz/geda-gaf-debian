    build-sys: Correct `dist-hook' for gnetlist common tests.
    
    In commit b0613e375ab8, it became valid for some common tests not to
    generate output, and subsequently in commit fde0b77b96ef, some `bom2'
    and `bom' backend golden files were removed to make use of this.
    However, the `dist-hook' rule in the gnetlist common test Makefile.am
    still assumed that all tests needed golden output files.  This patch
    corrects this, and un-breaks `make distcheck'.

    gnetlist: Regenerate `bom' and `bom2' test results.
    
    In commit 76bc345ee043, the `bom' and `bom2' backends were modified to
    be more informative about attribute list specifications.  As a
    side-effect of this work, the backend options for these backends are
    now much more strictly validated.  Tests which pass `-O include_mode'
    or `-O sort_mode' to gnetlist therefore now fail for the BOM backends,
    and this patch updates the golden files appropriately.

    Updated the problematic name attributes in some symbols
    
    In some gnetlist backends the name=? attributes cause problems because
    they look like valid attribute values. eg file=? may be mistaken for a
    valid filepath, and value=? for an actual value. Changing them to
    name=unknown is one way to solve this problem in the interim. It's now
    safe to remove the special checks for these "?" like the one in
    spice-sdb. This patch updates these problematic name=? attributes in
    some symbols to name=unknown, and removes FIXME code snipit that
    checked for the ? value in spice-sdb.
    
    It also updates gnetlist tests to reflect these changes. Turns out
    that the test input file TwoStageAmp.sch had a ? in it, which of couse
    caused problems.  Then when it was removed vams's output changed so it
    had to be fixed, which wasn't a very clever fix but seems to work.

    libgeda: Use UTF-8 instead of locale Scheme string functions.
    
    Note that there are several places where locale string functions are
    still used, because the input depends on the current locale
    (e.g. strings obtained from command-line options or from the
    filesystem).
    
    There are still a lot of places where we're still treating
    locale-dependent strings as UTF-8 strings (and probably vice-versa).

    Based on a suggestion by Patrick Bernaud that it would be useful for
    gnetlist backends to be able to accept more complex options on the
    gnetlist command line, this patch adds the (gnetlist backend-getopt)
    Scheme module to gnetlist.
    
    This provides convenience functions that allow a backend to easily
    handle several different types of `-O' backend option: flag options,
    options with arguments, and options with optional arguments.

    gsch2pcb: Don't pass invalid function names to m4.
    
    This fixes a long-standing bug with gsch2pcb.  gsch2pcb expects
    `footprint' attributes to be of the form:
    
      footprint=NAME ARG1 ARG2
    
    This gets transformed to:
    
      PKG_NAME (`NAME-ARG1-ARG2',`refdes',`value',`ARG1',`ARG2')
    
    for macro-expansion by M4.  For this to work, it requires that NAME
    matches the regular expression ^[A-Za-z0-9_]$ so that PKG_NAME is a
    valid M4 function name.
    
    It is quite common for users (especially those using John Luciani's
    footprint library) to define and wish to use footprint names which
    contain hyphens '-'.  Since this character is not valid in M4 function
    names, this practice causes non-obvious breakage to occur.
    
    This patch stops gsch2pcb from ever attempting to macro-expand a
    footprint NAME which is obviously not valid as part of an M4 function
    name.

    Print message and exit if rc file load fails.
    
    Modifies g_rc_parse() to print useful messages to standard error and
    exit with non-zero status if an error other than ENOENT occurs while
    attempting to parse any configuration file.
    
    N.b. only copes with rc files loaded at startup; rc files loaded later
    (e.g. a gafrc auto-loaded while loading a schematic using gschem
    "File->Open") can't cause the application to die.
    
    Since this means that under some circumstances gschem and gattrib can
    appear to do nothing silently (e.g. when launched from via a .desktop
    file) subsequent patches need to make gschem and gattrib generate
    appropriate warning and/or error message dialogs.

    gnetlist: NoConnection nets with more than 1 pin are an error in drc2 backend.
    
    Adding the NoConnection DRC attribute to a net causes the drc2 backend
    to ignore it when checking for unconnected nets. However, drc2
    currently doesn't enforce that the net is actually unconnected. It's
    possible to mark two pins as NoConnection and then accidentally wire
    them together. This patch to gnet-drc2.scm checks for that case.

    The gnetlist `-e', `-I', `-n' and `-s' command-line options are only
    used by the `spice-sdb' backend.  They have equivalents based on the
    `-O' option.  Remove them.

    gnetlist: Handle hierarchy refdes correctly in partslist*. [3044478]
    
    When producing a part list with the partslist[1-3] backend the refdes
    values output to the file do not contain the prepended refdeses of the
    parent component.
    
    E.g.
    
    Master schematic with symbol 'S1' (representing sub-schematic) and a
    resistor 'R1' Sub-schematic containing resistor 'R1'
    
    The geda backend produces a netlist containing two resistors 'R1' and
    'S1/R1', they're unique and everything is fine and dandy.  The
    partslist[1-3] backends contain two components with the refdes 'R1'
    which then causes problems when processing this file further.
    
    This is caused by the partslist[1-3] backends adding the value of the
    refdes attribute to the file rather than the value returned by the
    'packages' function.
    
    The supplied patch alters the backends to use the value from the
    packages function directly, rather than looking up the refdes
    attribute of the component.

    build-sys: Don't use AC_HEADER_DIRENT.
    
    The Autoconf manual says that AC_HEADER_DIRENT is now unnecessary:
    
         This macro is obsolescent, as all current systems with directory
         libraries have `dirent.h'.  New programs need not use this
         macro.
    
    This patch removes AC_HEADER_DIRENT and all checks for HAVE_DIRENT_H.
    It turned out that in most of the places where `dirent.h' was being
    #include'd it wasn't needed anyway.
    
    (Fix for a Cygwin build bug reported by Dan McMahill).

    build-sys: Improve HTML conversion rules.
    
    We want to make sure the HTML version of the man pages is always
    distributed, but make building/installing it optional (in case users
    don't have a proper groff installed).
    
    This can be achieved by making sure that Automake only tries to
    install the HTML man pages if a working groff is available.  In
    addition, `make distcheck' is set up to behave as if groff is not
    installed.
    
    Unfortunately, this still isn't ideal, because users who build from a
    source archive (with pre-built HTML) won't get HTML installed unless
    they have a working groff.
    
    In the long run, what needs to happen is to use a mechanism like
    `missing' to handle rebuilding of HTML man pages -- or just drop HTML
    man pages altogether.

    * Removed even more trace of the old prototype mechanism from the Makefiles.
    * Removed the cleanup of configure scripts which are no longer there (or
      for that matter were never in the same directory as some of these
      Makefiles).
    * Removal of some files from the *CLEANFILES rules which never existed.

    Makefile.am cleanup (removal of ChangeLog and Makefile.in files)
    
    Details on this commit:
    * Now that we are no longer storing machine generated ChangeLogs inside
      the git repository, make maintainer-clean should remove the machine
      generated ChangeLogs.  This way nobody accidently edits the ChangeLog.
      Only 7 ChangeLogs are left after a make maintainer-clean (intl, po,
      and one toplevel ChangeLog).
    * Some directories were missing the removal of Makefile.in when make
      maintainer-clean is run.  Only 3 Makefile.in files remain now after
      make maintainer-clean (only in the intl directories).
    * Removed $Id$ tags from some of the Makefiles since we are no longer
      using CVS.
    * Removed some unnecessary ChangeLogs from ever being created (from
      example/gTAG gschem/scripts, and symbol/font).
    
    Note 1: There are still some machine generated files still hanging around,
    but I'm going to leave those alone for now as the .gitignore mechanism
    properly masks those.
    
    Note 2: Made sure that all files that are to be removed in the *CLEANFILES
    lists comes before the #*# otherwise they will be ignored.

    include it.  Also libgeda/docs/images isn't integrated into the build
    properly yet, so it will not be in the distribution for now.

    gnetlist: Tell tests how to find uninstalled files.
    
    Tell test how to find the symbols and config files they need without
    installing them.  Mostly horrible hacks:
    
    - gnetlistrc files were added to every test directory to explicitly
      load the component libraries required by the test.
    
    - The GEDADATARC environment variable was set to allow the tests to
      load the appropriate system-<app>rc file.  Unfortunately, it wasn't
      possible to get the tests to load system-gafrc.
    
    - Some careful choices of whether to use ${srcdir} or ${builddir}.
    
    With this commit, make distcheck once again passes.

    the default settings in system-gnetlistrc, according to the principle

    gnetlist: Recursive make less recursively.
    
    1. The gnetlist testsuite uses a large number of almost-identical
       directories which each contain a predictably-named set of result
       files.  In the past, each of these directories have included their
       own Makefile.am.  By using a `dist-hook' rule in
       gnetlist/tests/common/Makefile.am, all of these Makefiles can be
       removed.
    
    2. Several directories similarly use a Makefile.am with an EXTRA_DIST
       rule for only a handful of files.  If this information is added to
       a higher-level directory, several recursive Makefiles can be
       removed.
    
    Reducing the number of Makefiles that need to be recursively processed
    saves time during automake invocation, during configuration and at
    compile-time.

    Quote pins names if they contain comma or close parenthesis. [2823703]
    
    A comma or close parenthesis will cause problems with the pcb action
    script, so if one of the arguments to ChangePinName contains one it
    should be quoted.  Any quote characters within the argument are
    escaped.
    
    Right now it only quotes if there is a comma or close parenthesis. We
    could just quote all pin names to future proof it against more special
    characters in the action argument, but this seems less intrusive and
    doesn't affect those without a new pcb that accepts quotes in the
    arguments.
    
    (Minor formatting changes and addition of comments made by Peter B
    prior to committing).

    Remove gschem2pcb and the PCBboard gnetlist backend.
    
    gschem2pcb is the old script which has long since been replaced with
    gsch2pcb.  The PCBboard gnetlist backend was only used by gschem2pcb
    and has been superceded by the gsch2pcb gnetlist backend.  This
    removes a lot of duplicated and no-longer-maintained code and hopefully
    removes a new user pitfall (using gschem2pcb instead of gsch2pcb).

    Add a -d | --debug option that preserves the run directory.
    
    This helps with testing/debugging because it allows an easy creation
    of a scratch directory for running gnetlist.

    Allow user configuration of the pcb m4 program and directories via gafrc.
    Besides allowing for additional runtime control by users, this provides
    a mechanism that the testsuite can use to focus on testing gnetlist and
    not testing changes in pcb's footprint library.  The testsuite now uses
    
      cat - >> outputfile
    
    Instead of feeding the gnetlist output through m4 before comparing to our
    reference.  This lets us test only the part gnetlist controls.

    Fix the testsuite when building outside the source tree.
    
    Since gnetlist currently only looks in a single directory for scheme
    files and since some of our scheme files are generated at build time
    we need to copy over the other source .scm files to the build directory
    for the testsuite to run.  Longer term, we should either
    
    a) consolidate all of the testsuite into a single master script that
       starts by merging all the scheme files into a single directory
    
    or
    
    b) teach gnetlist to have a scheme search path.  Even with this,
       testsuite consolidation would be good.

    Require Guile 1.8.0 or newer.
    
    Guile 1.8 became the stable branch of Guile on 2006-02-12, over three
    *years* ago. All major distributions ship it, including Debian stable.
    
    Expecting its availability makes testing of new Scheme-based features
    much easier, as most gEDA developers normally write and test code
    against 1.8. Furthermore, it allows better advantage to be taken of
    1.8-only features (such as improvements in debugging support), without
    requiring vast swathes of hard-to-maintain preprocessor trickery.

    a matching "pinnumber=..." attribute.
    
    The new function takes an explicit attribute name argument as well as
    the value, so we can find pins by any attached attribute. This is useful
    so we can search by "pinseq=..." attributes as well.

    This function was only used in one place, and probably didn't deserve its

    could probably be removed completely at some point. (Although it forms
    part of the scheme API for gnetlist, comments above it suggest that it is
    "still highly temp and doesn't work right"). It is not requied by any
    known (shipped) gnetlist backends.

    Write logs to $HOME/.gEDA/logs/.
    
    Rewrite s_log_init() to put log files in a centralised location. A
    user application (e.g. gnetlist) provides a prefix, and log file is
    opened at:
    
       $HOME/.gEDA/logs/<prefix>-<YYYYmmdd>-<serial>.log       [1]
    
    The serial is found by the following procedure:
    
    1. Read through the directory to find the highest existing <serial>.
    
    2. Starting with that number, repeatedly attempt to open()
       incrementing files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL flags to guarantee that a
       new file is created.
    
    3. If after LOG_OPEN_ATTEMPTS = 5 attempts a unique filename hasn't
       been found, fail.
    
    The logic *intentionally* does not fill in gaps in the sequence -- if
    I delete logs, I still want a new log to appear at the end of the
    list.
    
    [1] The actual location is a subdirectory "logs" of the user config
        directory, which may not be ~/.gEDA on all platforms.

    gnetlist: Teach netlist traversal code to understand buses (still disabled)
    
    Up until recently, the connection scanning code has rejected some, but not
    all buses. This means that it is unlikely graphical buses formed a useful
    part of anyone's design, since the netlist code in s_traverse_net()
    would not follow connections to another bus segment. The only possible
    bus-pin connectivity has ever been "pin-bus-pin", or "pin-bus-net-...".
    
    This behaviour appears to have been accidental, and would not have been
    easy for a user to take advantage of. The traversal code would not move
    on to a subsequent bus, but would, for example, allow a pin->bus->!bus
    connection, which could then connect onwards. The bus mixed up in this
    would for all intents and purposes behave as a net.
    
    The pin->bus validity bug was actually fixed in libgeda when adding
    support for bus pins. This commit formalises it further, since if
    support for netlisting bus pins were enabled it would otherwise still
    be possible to get a buspin-bus-net-... connection if you tried hard.
    
    Introduce type-checking between pins, nets and buses such that they can
    not netlist where the object types don't match. For buses, the code to
    name a connection based on "netname", "net" or "label" attributes is
    disabled - pending decision as to what constructs we wish to use for
    naming buses. Add a gnetlistrc setting (unnamed-busname ...) which sets
    the default naming (if the connection scanning code were run on bus pins).
    
    This commit lays some of the ground work for shared connection scanning
    code for determining the connectivity of buses and bus pins.

    gnetlist: Disable traversal of bus pins when checking connectivity.
    
    We don't want graphical buses to be netlisted at present. Currently
    their output (although not correct connectivity in all but simple
    cases) can get muddled up with the normal netlist fed to backends.

    gnetlist: Refactor s_traverse_component() and s_traverse_net() slightly.
    
    Removes some duplicated code by not special-casing the first level of
    recursion when tracing out connections.
    
    The only outward change from this commit should be that nets / pins found
    immediately connected to a pin being inspected get their "n" or "P" print
    in the verbose debugging output. (One of the codepaths being consolidated
    didn't have them before). Unconneced pins no longer get a "p" print, since
    the traversal code isn't executed for them.

    gnetlist: Avoid depending on GHashTable ordering for output consistency
    
    If the GLib hash table changes (which it has in late versions of GLib),
    the netlist output ordering changes due to our mis-use of GHashTable to
    list all unique component names without enforcing any eplicit order on
    the enumeration of the hash table contents.
    
    Since ordering may be important to backends, want to have known output
    ordering whilst removing duplicate entrys, but without an explicit sort
    of the refdes list.
    
    This commit introduces an incremental build of the list, first checking
    the hash table for a hit, and only adding the new refdes if it wasn't
    already in the has table. This is gives the output a predictable order
    (based on the input), rather than inserting all refdes into the hash
    table, and building the list in whatever order the table implentation
    traverses them in.
    
    This change does unfortunately means a large number or ordering related
    changes are also made in the gnetlist test suite's golden files.
    
    There are also some non-ordering changes in the checked in golden files.
    These is encountered in the pretty well obsolete PCBboard backend - which
    errors out when it hits certain components it can't find footprints for.
    Changing the ordering changes the point at which it dies, and thus the
    netlist output. Lets just accept these changes as is.

    gschem: Don't define key-bindings for keys which have no-action
    
    If we do this, then when we set "no-action" to a menu item's key binding,
    the code will try to display one of the keys associated with "no-action"
    as a binding for that menu item.

    The changes in 51c2a5c9f7f9ad1c99b9da2774a051ae97f3e62e caused the

    Change part of bom2 backend to use tail recursion, avoiding stack
    overflows for very large schematics. Tested with up to 1024 devices,

    problematic.

    This reverts commit 9928a19d3374c5d7ff672f8435a5f29476b2bba2.
    
    gnetlist should not exit with a status of 0 when encountering
    an error. This behaviour change has been fixed in commit
    16102ef095c959b5c1febb9b9259dda23c739258, which reverted part
    of commit 2a4fdb13021d0153e788fe3b2fc005f273dcdf4b, where the
    changes were first introduced.

    Quick fix for gnetlist exit status.
    
    In 2a4fdb13021d0153e788fe3b2fc005f273dcdf4b, gnetlist was modified to
    use g_scm_c_eval_string_protected() to call into
    backends. Unfortunately, this had the side effect of stopping Guile
    errors thrown by backends from causing gnetlist to exit with non-zero
    exit status.
    
    This is a quick fix which partially reverts the offending commit.

    gnetlist: Update golden files for backends which hit errors.
    
    Gnetlist now returns with an exit code of 0, even when it encounters
    problems from inside the backend's scheme code, and that code exits
    with an (error ...) call. Update the golden files to reflect this.

    gnetlist: Update common test-suite outputs for "systemc" backend
    
    Updated after fixing the backend to run again.
    
    NB: A cursory inspection of the "golden" files, suggests that the outputs
        being checked in are not actually correct. However, the test-suite
        will serve to tell us if any changes are made in gnetlist which affect
        this backend.

    gnetlist: Fixup systemc backend
    
    Don't escape < and > characters in strings, as guile doesn't like this.
    
    Apply similar fixes as those made to the VHDL and verilog backends after
    some changes in gnetlist to accomodate slotting in spice-sdb. Since the
    netlist backend is loaded before gnetlist has traversed the schematic, it
    must not execute any code which queries gnetlist on load. All such work
    is to be done only when gnetlist invokes the "systemc" method.
    
    Move (define c_p #f) to outside (systemc:components ...)'s (lambda ...)
    function, since guile doesn't appreciate us mixing declarations and
    expressions. This variable is tested and (set! c_p #t) later on, which
    doesn't feel very scheme like. The fix works for now though.
    
    Check to see if the regexp matched netname, checking for "name<type>" has
    hit a match before trying to get a piece of that match. If the regexp
    returns #f, instead just treat the identifier as a "name" and use that.
    This allows net names which don't conform to the regexp to at least give
    some vaguely sensible output, without crashing the backend.
    
    Comment some debugging prints to stdout, giving a cleaner looking run.

    Tolerated changes in golden files for the spice netlist backend.
    
    The way slotted parts are handled has changed since 1.2.0, as
    has the output of the spice backend for slotted parts. Since
    the spice backend doesn't properly support slotted components,
    we allow these output changes.

    This backend was removed from the common test-suite prior to the last

    awk that is good enough for the scripts that use them.  Now use this result
    in various scripts instead of hard coding 'gawk' (not available on all systems)
    or 'awk' (picks up the original awk which is not sufficiently advanced on solaris).
    
    Also avoid calling out /bin/bash on scripts for which /bin/sh (even on solaris) should
    be sufficient.  Not all systems have /bin/bash.
    
    Finally, improve temp file usage in shell scripts for improved security.

    Make sure that 'make check' works correctly prior to installation.  The
    old test seemed to be picking up a previously installed gnetlist instead
    of the one we just built.  Makes for some confusing debugging if there is

    Revert applying -Werror to compiler flags when linking with GCC (CODE!!)
    
    Depending on the gcc version, the original developers might not see the
    warning until the software gets into the end user's hands (and tries
    building it with an older/newer version of gcc).  Most warnings are
    not catastropic, but by using -Werror they are _all_ catastropic.
    
    If a developer wants to get rid of all warnings, they should either:
    
     1) run make -s and see/fix all the warnings, and/or
     2) modify the Makefile's themselves and add the -Werror flag temporarily.
    
    (Comments explaining rationale snipped out of an email from Ales).

    Because the reporter's version of Guile is broken, a lovely garbage
    collector segfault occurs if a null string is passed to

    For now, wrap all calls to scm_c_eval_string() with mutable arguments
    in g_scm_c_eval_string_protected(), and since the latter function
    seems to behave when passed a NULL string this bug should just go
    away.

    gnetlist: Tidy vams_get_package_attributes() and vams_get_attribs_list()
    
    Refactor the code to be cleaner, fixup whitespace, remove old debug cruft.

    Remove ineffective search inside symbol in vams_get_package_attributes()
    
    The call to vams_get_attribs_list (...->complex->prim_objs, ...) will
    always fail to return names. This function operates on the passed
    OBJECT, looking at OBJECT->attribs. In this case, the passed OBJECT
    will always be a complex head node with no attributes.
    
    We _might_ want to list the names of any floating attributes inside the
    object (as seems to have been intended in the original code), however
    all "interesting" generic attributes will probably have been promoted to
    the outside anyway. Promotable attributes inside symbols are only hidden
    by default (not deleted), so listing the internal attributes would mean
    we end up with two copies of each promotable attribute in our SCM list.
    
    There are also quite a number of uninteresting attributes inside most
    symbols which we may not want listing as generics. For now delete the
    broken code attempting to list internal attribute names.
    
    This commit doesn't change any netlist output.

    gnetlist: Don't drop all hierarchy prefix for children without refdes=...
    
    If a hierarchy block is missing its refdes=... attribute, insert it
    without any change of hierarchy prefix. The block's contents keep the
    same hierarchy level as the instantiating schematic. Previously the block
    was inserted at the root level, with no hierarchical name mangling.
    
    This may be useful in some cases if you want to suspend hiearchy mangling
    for certain portions of a hierarchical design. (NB: You would then be
    responsible for avoiding refdes name clashes). A similar effect can be be
    obtained on a design wide basis by setting the options:
    (hierarchy-*-mangle "disabled") in a gnetlistrc file.

    Tolerated changes in golden files for the vipec netlist backend.
    
    The way slotted parts are handled has changed since 1.2.0, as
    has the output of the vipec backend for slotted parts. Since
    this backend isn't likely to care about slotted parts, we allow
    these output changes as harmless.

    We want to track changes in netlist backend behaviour since version 1.2.0,

    differences in outputs for some backends. We can explicitly confirm
    thoses changes as desired or tolerable by checking in new golden files.

    The tests are applied to all backends, with control files being used to
    document the expected return codes, and golden files with the expected
    output. These files are generated from a 1.5.0 development release of
    of the gEDA suite, and do not in all cases represent "correct" behaviour,
    merely "gEDA 1.5.0" behaviour.

    Make the pads netlist backend use CR/LF instead of just LF.
    
    Based on a discussion on the gEDA mailing lists it seems that PADS
    (which runs only on windows) needs DOS style netlists and not unix
    style netlists.  So rather than forcing a unix2dos step in beween
    netlisting and using the result, go ahead and teach the pads netlist
    backend to directly write out a DOS style netlist.  Update the
    testsuite accordingly.

    Fix verilog and VHDL netlist backends
    
    These were inadvertently broken when making core gnetlist changes to
    accomodate slotting in spice-sdb. Since the netlist backend is loaded
    before gnetlist has traversed the schematic, the backends must not
    execute any code which queries gnetlist on load. All such work is
    to be done only when gnetlist invokes the (<backend>) method.

    Revert "gnetlist: Strip trailing lower case suffixes from PCB package names"
    
    Stripping lower case refdes suffixes when netlisting for PCB (which
    ignores lowercase refdes suffixes) caused breakage when relying on
    matching a pinlabel=xxx to refdes=xxx inside a hierarchical
    schematic, where "xxx" had a lowercase suffix.
    
    This reverts commit e8b3be0fbcbf7518b05b437e13eeaa11478345aa.

    gnetlist: Strip trailing lower case suffixes from PCB package names
    
    Adds a custom (get-uref ...) function to the PCB, pcbpins and gsch2pcb
    back-ends. These strip lowercase suffixes from the uref, to ensure that
    slotted package names like IC1a and IC1b are treated as the same, IC1
    by gsch2pcb.
    
    This suffix stripping matches the fact that PCB ignores the lower-case
    suffix on net names. It would have been possible to leave the suffixes
    in the PCB and pcbpins output, although in the PCB netlist case, this
    causes any implicit power nets in each slot to be duplicated in the
    netlist, which PCB reports as an error.

    Fix spice-sdb slotting to work without modified pinseq attributes
    
    Removes all previous code which iterated over slots for a given package,
    replacing it with a custom (get-uref ...) procedure which ensures each
    slot of a component is given a unique uref when gnetlist traverses the
    schematic. This means each slot will appear as a separate "package" in
    the gnetlist data-structures, even if each slot uses the same refdes=
    attribute.
    
    The format for the package uref is "(refdes/uref).(slot)", in keeping
    with the existing spice-sdb slotting code.

    gnetlist: Load gnetlist.scm and backend before schematic traversal.
    
    Allows gnetlist.scm and backends to define scheme procedures and
    variables which may be used to control the schematic traversal process.
    
    Since some portions of of gnetlist.scm are evaluated immediately upon
    load, yet require execution _after_  schematic traversal, these portions
    have been split out from gnetlist.scm into a new file, gnetlist-post.scm
    which is loaded after traversal.
    
    The moved definitions are those of "packages", "all-unique-nets",
    "all-nets", "all-pins", and the refdes aliasing functionality.

    Fix configure checks for Guile.
    
    Quote variables to protect them and alter version test logic so that
    it doesn't think version 2.1 is older than 1.8.

    gnetlist: Make drc2 backend not emit exceptions.
    
    The drc2 backend reports drc violations by emitting an error, but it
    can do it more gracefully using the Guile display function.

    XML files. Run gettextize after intltoolize if required, so that the
    infrastructure for providing libintl on a non GNU system still works.

    This patch actually *removes* error message output from file loading
    errors is some cases.  This is for the sake of keeping the patch
    concise, and will be addressed in later patches.

    Remove the ATTRIB linked list in favour of a GList
    
    The ATTRIB.copied_to pointer is moved from the ATTRIB struct to reside in
    the source OBJECT being copied.
    
    The ATTRIB *attached_to pointer of an attribute's text OBJECT is changed
    to OBJECT *attached_to, pointing directly at the OBJECT to which that
    attribute is attached. This avoids the need to traverse the ATTRIB list
    and retrieve this pointer from the HEAD attribute node. (A HEAD node is
    not used in the GList of ATTRIBs).
    
    The ATTRIB structure now only contains one element, OBJECT *object. This
    points to the text OBJECT holding and displaying that attribute's
    "name=value".

    Avoid accessing (GList)->{next|priv} directly to aid debugging.
    
    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    Fix for Bug#1776547: graphical versus source
    
    The usage described in Bug#1776547 is pretty unique, but it might be handy
    to support in general.  The recursive source= and graphical= behavior is
    a unexpected side effect of the traversal of graphical symbols/components
    (552e06e921e4b6eb758b9483d1913c39b3fef5f5).  The fix is to explicitly
    check for the graphical= attribute and if it is found to not further
    traverse the hierarchy.  Regression tests were added so this behavior
    doesn't change in the future.

    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Portability fixes for the testsuite.
    
    Get the testsuite fully working on SunOS-5.9/sparc.  This
    entails two issues.  The "-I" option to diff is a GNU
    extension and is not supported by the solaris diff.  Work
    around this by using sed to filter out the lines which were
    to be ignored.  This addresses the tests run by gnetlist/tests/runtest.sh.
    
    The other issue is that the longopts tests in the spice-sdb
    testsuite should not be run on a system that does not have
    getopt_long().  To address this, extend the run_tests.sh to allow
    a variable in the tests.list file to disable a test unless set to "yes".

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    problem by adding files to EXTRA_DIST in automake input files.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.
