    gsch2pcb: Handle unit suffixes at element update.
    
    gsch2pcb rewrites the Element() line while it updates an element. The
    coordinates are interpreted by atoi(). New versions of PCB uses unit
    suffixes like 12.4mm. When this read by atoi(), it'll return only the
    integer part. It then writes back to the Element, without suffix. PCB
    then interpret as micro inches.

    gsch2pcb: Follow g_spawn_sync() documentation and pass required flags
    
    The documentation for g_spawn_sync() tells us that we must pass the
    flags G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL and G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL if we
    pass NULL for the stdout and stderr returns from the command.
    
    These flags cause g_spawn_sync() to redirect stdout and stderr to
    /dev/null rather than assigning pipes to them.
    
    No known bug is fixed by this, but it is possible that without these
    flags, either the stdout or stderr pipes' buffer could become full if
    the command executing emits enough data. This might lead to both
    processes stalling.
    
    Whilst I was touching this code, I added some comments as to the
    meaning of the various NULL arguments we pass to g_spawn_sync().

    gsch2pcb: NULL termiate the argument list to g_spawn_sync()
    
    Fixes mysterious failures which leave a message on the console:
    
      gsch2pcb: gnetlist command failed, `<FILENAME>' not updated
         at least gnetlist 20030901 is required for m4-xxx options.
    
    Could potentially be a security flaw, as the argument list to execute
    would be parsed off the end of unallocated memory until a NULL pointer
    happened to be found.
    
    Might fix crashes, but couldn't find any relevant bug reports.

    Remove OBJECT->sel_func in favour of an OBJECT->selectable flag
    
    Only gschem called OBJECT->sel_func anyway, so lets avoid passing vfunc
    pointers everywhere as a flag. This has the added benefit of removing
    some dummy functions from gattrib and gschlas which were only present
    so the status of locked objects could be preserved across load/save.

    Print message and exit if rc file load fails.
    
    Modifies g_rc_parse() to print useful messages to standard error and
    exit with non-zero status if an error other than ENOENT occurs while
    attempting to parse any configuration file.
    
    N.b. only copes with rc files loaded at startup; rc files loaded later
    (e.g. a gafrc auto-loaded while loading a schematic using gschem
    "File->Open") can't cause the application to die.
    
    Since this means that under some circumstances gschem and gattrib can
    appear to do nothing silently (e.g. when launched from via a .desktop
    file) subsequent patches need to make gschem and gattrib generate
    appropriate warning and/or error message dialogs.

    build-sys: Don't use AC_HEADER_DIRENT.
    
    The Autoconf manual says that AC_HEADER_DIRENT is now unnecessary:
    
         This macro is obsolescent, as all current systems with directory
         libraries have `dirent.h'.  New programs need not use this
         macro.
    
    This patch removes AC_HEADER_DIRENT and all checks for HAVE_DIRENT_H.
    It turned out that in most of the places where `dirent.h' was being
    #include'd it wasn't needed anyway.
    
    (Fix for a Cygwin build bug reported by Dan McMahill).

    build-sys: Improve HTML conversion rules.
    
    We want to make sure the HTML version of the man pages is always
    distributed, but make building/installing it optional (in case users
    don't have a proper groff installed).
    
    This can be achieved by making sure that Automake only tries to
    install the HTML man pages if a working groff is available.  In
    addition, `make distcheck' is set up to behave as if groff is not
    installed.
    
    Unfortunately, this still isn't ideal, because users who build from a
    source archive (with pre-built HTML) won't get HTML installed unless
    they have a working groff.
    
    In the long run, what needs to happen is to use a mechanism like
    `missing' to handle rebuilding of HTML man pages -- or just drop HTML
    man pages altogether.

    * Removal of some files from the *CLEANFILES rules which never existed.

    badly.  This bug was ticked by the next commit (where the package name was
    lengthened).

    Makefile.am cleanup (removal of ChangeLog and Makefile.in files)
    
    Details on this commit:
    * Now that we are no longer storing machine generated ChangeLogs inside
      the git repository, make maintainer-clean should remove the machine
      generated ChangeLogs.  This way nobody accidently edits the ChangeLog.
      Only 7 ChangeLogs are left after a make maintainer-clean (intl, po,
      and one toplevel ChangeLog).
    * Some directories were missing the removal of Makefile.in when make
      maintainer-clean is run.  Only 3 Makefile.in files remain now after
      make maintainer-clean (only in the intl directories).
    * Removed $Id$ tags from some of the Makefiles since we are no longer
      using CVS.
    * Removed some unnecessary ChangeLogs from ever being created (from
      example/gTAG gschem/scripts, and symbol/font).
    
    Note 1: There are still some machine generated files still hanging around,
    but I'm going to leave those alone for now as the .gitignore mechanism
    properly masks those.
    
    Note 2: Made sure that all files that are to be removed in the *CLEANFILES
    lists comes before the #*# otherwise they will be ignored.

    include it.  Also libgeda/docs/images isn't integrated into the build
    properly yet, so it will not be in the distribution for now.

    Reduce stderr spew.
    
    It's not necessary to spew massive amounts of output to stderr on
    startup. It's ugly and not legally necessary.
    
    This patch modifies the tools only to spew a GPL header to stderr when
    entering gnetlist's interactive mode -- and to be nice and quiet the rest of
    the time.

    Fix autogen.sh scripts to look for AC_CONFIG_HEADER to run autoheader
    
    Since commit #9a7c363c572d32a30fa1522cd7d14b21c2958ca8, the configure
    scripts in gEDA use AC_CONFIG_HEADER, not AM_CONFIG_HEADER
    
    Fixes build problems noted by various users. Identified by Dan McMahill.

    Require Guile 1.8.0 or newer.
    
    Guile 1.8 became the stable branch of Guile on 2006-02-12, over three
    *years* ago. All major distributions ship it, including Debian stable.
    
    Expecting its availability makes testing of new Scheme-based features
    much easier, as most gEDA developers normally write and test code
    against 1.8. Furthermore, it allows better advantage to be taken of
    1.8-only features (such as improvements in debugging support), without
    requiring vast swathes of hard-to-maintain preprocessor trickery.

    tragesym: put attributes on top if there are no top pins
    
    If you put pins on either the top or bottom of a symbol, tragesym
    moved the name around and changes the positioning. However, this is
    only necessary if pins are on top, and the logic should ignore pins on
    the bottom.

    Write logs to $HOME/.gEDA/logs/.
    
    Rewrite s_log_init() to put log files in a centralised location. A
    user application (e.g. gnetlist) provides a prefix, and log file is
    opened at:
    
       $HOME/.gEDA/logs/<prefix>-<YYYYmmdd>-<serial>.log       [1]
    
    The serial is found by the following procedure:
    
    1. Read through the directory to find the highest existing <serial>.
    
    2. Starting with that number, repeatedly attempt to open()
       incrementing files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL flags to guarantee that a
       new file is created.
    
    3. If after LOG_OPEN_ATTEMPTS = 5 attempts a unique filename hasn't
       been found, fail.
    
    The logic *intentionally* does not fill in gaps in the sequence -- if
    I delete logs, I still want a new log to appear at the end of the
    list.
    
    [1] The actual location is a subdirectory "logs" of the user config
        directory, which may not be ~/.gEDA on all platforms.

    gattrib, gschlas: Restore setting dummy select_func to ensure proper save
    
    The select_func function pointer (now owned and exported by libgeda) is
    assigned to OBJECT->sel_func for non-locked objects. Locking is achieved
    by setting OBJECT->sel_func to NULL, and when writing out objects, the
    locked flag is determined by comparing that that pointer to NULL.
    
    We need to keep providing a dummy function so we can differentiate
    between that and a NULL pointer. This was accidentally lost in
    commit 1aab94354f053887db67aa5702abc595795dfe82 which moved the
    select_func global variable into libgeda.

    Revert applying -Werror to compiler flags when linking with GCC (CODE!!)
    
    Depending on the gcc version, the original developers might not see the
    warning until the software gets into the end user's hands (and tries
    building it with an older/newer version of gcc).  Most warnings are
    not catastropic, but by using -Werror they are _all_ catastropic.
    
    If a developer wants to get rid of all warnings, they should either:
    
     1) run make -s and see/fix all the warnings, and/or

    utils: Adjust Makefile.am so we add $(AM_CFLAGS) to {appname}_CFLAGS
    
    This allows us to add CFLAGS to all targets from the AM_CFLAGS variable.
    
    Also export app-specific CFLAGS from configure.ac for gmk_sym,
    smash_megafile, convert_sym, sarlacc_schem and olib rather than
    copying those for gschlas inside Makefile.am. This keeps things
    cleaner should either set of CFLAGS need to change in the future.

    Use -Werror when building with gcc compilers. (More Makefile.am)
    
    Hopefully this will help to ensure compiler warnings get noticed
    and fixed by developers.
    
    Some Makefile.am with compiled sources were missed in the last
    (accidental) commit relating to these CFLAGS.

    Use pkg-config support for Guile if present.
    
    Using pkg-config allows easier cross-compilation, since the build
    process can use a pkg-config binary native to the build machine with .pc
    files for the host machine.

    Fix non-literal format strings which cause compiler warnings.
    
    We should be careful to avoid passing arbitrary strings into functions
    which take printf style arguments. In that case, always use the construct
    ("%s", string) rather than passing string as the format argument.
    
    Some cases were fixed by using g_strdup instead of g_strdup_printf(),
    some simply replace printf() for puts().

    applications should then override them as required near their call to
    libgeda_init().

    tragesym: improved text alignment of top/bottom pin numbers. Version 0.0.14
    
    The origin of the top and bottom pin numbers and pin sequence did not have
    the same relativ position to the pin compared to the left and right pin.
    Fixed this relativ positions and the text alignments.
    This cosmetic issue was reported by Stefan Salewski. [1945153]

    tragesym: fixed version string handling
    
    With the commit 5a35c238f19622f8045784fa61497c80c4144fa6 a trailing " 1"
    was added to the version string. This is only correct if the source files
    do not contain that part of the version definition.
    Changed tragesym to accept both version strings "20060113 1" and
    "20060113" in the source file. Bug pointed out by Stefan Salewski.

    reenabled pintype translation.
    Improved some test files.

    Added the use of PCBDATA environment variable to make gsch2pcb relocatable
    
    Before this patch, m4_pcbdir was being set from the preprocessor variable
    PCBDATADIR which was set at ./configure time.  In order to be able to move
    gsch2pcb to a different install prefix, this path has to be changable at
    run-time.  If PCBDATA is not set, then PCBDATADIR is used (previous
    behavior).

    Avoid accessing (GList)->{next|priv} directly to aid debugging.
    
    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    Moved 3 rc promotion keywords from gschem into libgeda (fix for bug#1748143)
    
    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )

    Alter guile 1.6 compat tests to work with older autoconf versions
    
    Don't use AC_DEFINE to define function like macros, instead use
    AC_CHECK_DECLS to set a HAVE_DECL_..., then use AH_VERBATIM to
    insert a test which defines a replacement if necessary.

    Changed configure.ac(.in) to allow guile-1.6
    
    Introduces compatibility #defines where guile 1.8 funcs are missing in
    guile 1.6. Also adds missing configure.ac checks for guile in packages
    gattrib, gnetlist, gsymcheck and utils.

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated copyright text/header in most source files.
    
    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.

    Make sure various files are installed.
    
    Several new files were not being distributed. This patch addresses the
    problem by adding files to EXTRA_DIST in automake input files.

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.
