    symbols: Fix FreeBSD return status issue
    
    If the old installation directories for the gnetman, Verilog, and VHDL
    symbols exist, "make install" tries to remove the old symbols in order
    to make sure there aren't any duplicates left from an older
    installation (see commit 800b5e6).
    
    It appears shell exit codes work slightly different for FreeBSD, and an
    extra "|| true" is required to ignore errors from missing directories.

    symbols: Remove extra symbols from sym/ on "make install"
    
    Most users probably don't run "make uninstall", so the conflicting
    symbol libraries will be present in both "sym/" and "extra-sym/".
    
    As a workaround, remove any symbols installed to "extra-sym/" from
    "sym/" at installation time.

    build: Generate an empty ChangeLog when git history unavailable
    
    When no git history is available -- for example, when the git
    repository was cloned using the `--depth` option to limit the amount
    of git history downloaded -- the changelog-generation rule can fail
    because the changelog's base git commit (i.e. the 1.0 release tag)
    isn't available in the repository.
    
    This patch makes generation of `ChangeLog` succeed in that situation,
    by creating an empty log and printing a warning to stderr.  It allows
    `make dist` and `make distcheck` to pass on shallow clones.

    Updated the problematic name attributes in some symbols
    
    In some gnetlist backends the name=? attributes cause problems because
    they look like valid attribute values. eg file=? may be mistaken for a
    valid filepath, and value=? for an actual value. Changing them to
    name=unknown is one way to solve this problem in the interim. It's now
    safe to remove the special checks for these "?" like the one in
    spice-sdb. This patch updates these problematic name=? attributes in
    some symbols to name=unknown, and removes FIXME code snipit that
    checked for the ? value in spice-sdb.
    
    It also updates gnetlist tests to reflect these changes. Turns out
    that the test input file TwoStageAmp.sch had a ? in it, which of couse
    caused problems.  Then when it was removed vams's output changed so it
    had to be fixed, which wasn't a very clever fix but seems to work.

    Makefile.am cleanup (removal of ChangeLog and Makefile.in files)
    
    Details on this commit:
    * Now that we are no longer storing machine generated ChangeLogs inside
      the git repository, make maintainer-clean should remove the machine
      generated ChangeLogs.  This way nobody accidently edits the ChangeLog.
      Only 7 ChangeLogs are left after a make maintainer-clean (intl, po,
      and one toplevel ChangeLog).
    * Some directories were missing the removal of Makefile.in when make
      maintainer-clean is run.  Only 3 Makefile.in files remain now after
      make maintainer-clean (only in the intl directories).
    * Removed $Id$ tags from some of the Makefiles since we are no longer
      using CVS.
    * Removed some unnecessary ChangeLogs from ever being created (from
      example/gTAG gschem/scripts, and symbol/font).
    
    Note 1: There are still some machine generated files still hanging around,
    but I'm going to leave those alone for now as the .gitignore mechanism
    properly masks those.
    
    Note 2: Made sure that all files that are to be removed in the *CLEANFILES
    lists comes before the #*# otherwise they will be ignored.

       in `configure.ac' as well.

    libgeda: Emit each segment of paths on separate lines
    
    This allows greater redability of the path output, and simpler
    diffs when a single control point changes.
    
    Update the stock symbols which had paths emitted on a single line.
    Both read-back fine, but its best that we ship symbols in a state
    where a load / save cycle would not change the formatting.

    Rename "path" object identifier in the fileformat from "p" to "H"
    
    All other OBJECT type identifiers are upper case, and for consistency,
    now patHs are too.
    
    NB: No releases have been made since path support was added, so this
        change is still permissable.

    sorting by default so that that order is preserved.

    Alter system-gafrc to process .scm files in $GEDA_DATA_DIR/gafrc.d/
    
    This change allows each symbol package (e.g. geda-symbols) to install a
    scheme config file under this dir to load its contents. This allows
    additional symbol packages to be installed globally without needing to edit
    either geda-clib.scm or system-gafrc.
    
    Also moves the installation of geda-clib.scm into this directory.

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Make sure various files are installed.

    problem by adding files to EXTRA_DIST in automake input files.

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Refactor system RC files
    
    Moved system-gafrc into the libgeda package, where it belongs.
    Removed all environment and configure substitutions.  Created separate
    font and component library setup scripts in the symbols package,
    automatically loaded by system-gafrc if they exist.  Updated
    system-gschemrc to use new infrastructure.
