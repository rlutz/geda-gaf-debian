<p>
Here is a list of programs, libraries and other things that are
part of gEDA/gaf (gschem and friends).
</p>

</div>

<h2 id="schematiccapture">Schematic capture</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
<strong>gschem</strong>(1) is the schematic capture program/tool which is part
of gEDA. Its sole purpose is to facilitate the graphical input of
components/circuits. See the <a href="geda-gschem_ug.html" class="wikilink1" title="geda-gschem_ug.html">gschem User Guide</a>
for more information on the program.
</p>

</div>

<h2 id="netlisting">Netlisting</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
<strong>gnetlist</strong>(1) is a netlist generation program. It takes as input
gEDA/gaf .sch (schematic) files and the required .sym (symbol)
files and converts them into netlists. See the
<a href="geda-gnetlist_ug.html" class="wikilink1" title="geda-gnetlist_ug.html">gnetlist User Guide</a> for more information on
the program.
</p>

</div>

<h2 id="attributeediting">Attribute editing</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
<strong>gattrib</strong>(1) is gEDA&#039;s attribute editor. It reads a set of
gschem .sch files (schematic files), and creates a spreadsheet
showing all components in rows, with the associated component
attributes listed in the columns.
</p>

<p>
See also the <a href="geda-master_attributes_list.html" class="wikilink1" title="geda-master_attributes_list.html">Master Attributes

Symbols (on a schematic) are an abstract representation of the
physical components used in electronic circuits. Initial gEDA
installation provides you with default symbols contributed by many
