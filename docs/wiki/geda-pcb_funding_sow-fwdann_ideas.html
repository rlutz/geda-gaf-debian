<div class="level2">

<p>
This is what I&#039;m thinking for the forward annotation (gsch2pcb) design:
</p>

<p>
The PCB has a list of schematics that it gets info from.  Do we need
path support, or is full-paths (or relative to the pcb) ok?
Wildcards?  Anyway, the list of schematics is stored in the .pcb file
somehow.  The GUI needs a way to manage these, too.
</p>

<p>
When the user asks, PCB uses the list of schematics to run a gnetlist
command with my new backend, passing the list of schematics.  The
gnetlist spits out a list of actions, which pcb runs.  These actions
update the netlist, add any missing elements, and remove any
appropriate elements.  Elements which need new footprints are updated
(magically! in place! we hope ;).
</p>

<p>
Also, some additional attributes will be propogated to elements, like
vendor, vendor_part_number, etc.
</p>

<p>
If the import is part of a &quot;new board&quot; step, we place the parts and
disperse them, optimize the rats nest, etc.  No problem there.
</p>

<p>
What do we do with new elements if it&#039;s just an update?  Eventually,
I&#039;d like to have some separate container for &quot;unplaced elements&quot; but I
mean, what do we do for now?  I&#039;m wondering if disperse or autoplace
is smart enough to do something useful if we place the parts and
select them, on a partially laid out board.
</p>

<p>
I think this is enough information in the .pcb file that we can get
rid of gsch2pcb and the &quot;project&quot; file it uses.
</p>

<p>
It does mean that the pcb cares which schematics go with it, but the
schematics don&#039;t care which pcb they go with.  Schematics can be
reused/shared, boards generally can&#039;t.
