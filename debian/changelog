geda-gaf (1:1.5.4-0~pcjc2.1) jaunty; urgency=low

  * gEDA 1.5.4 upstream release
  * Initial attempt at unified debian package.
  * Based on geda-* Debian packages by Hamish Moffatt.
  * Fix dependancy of >= $UPSTREAM_VERSION to match the exact debian
    version of libgeda which was built with this source package.
  * Added conflict between geda-symbols and the old libgeda33 package,
    since the new symbols rely on file-format changes not present in
    that version.
  * Remove buggy workaround for gxyrs install location (fixed upstream)
  * Remove resetting of executable bit on some examples (fixed upstream)
