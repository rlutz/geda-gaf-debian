    Print message and exit if rc file load fails.
    
    Modifies g_rc_parse() to print useful messages to standard error and
    exit with non-zero status if an error other than ENOENT occurs while
    attempting to parse any configuration file.
    
    N.b. only copes with rc files loaded at startup; rc files loaded later
    (e.g. a gafrc auto-loaded while loading a schematic using gschem
    "File->Open") can't cause the application to die.
    
    Since this means that under some circumstances gschem and gattrib can
    appear to do nothing silently (e.g. when launched from via a .desktop
    file) subsequent patches need to make gschem and gattrib generate
    appropriate warning and/or error message dialogs.

    build-sys: Don't use AC_HEADER_DIRENT.
    
    The Autoconf manual says that AC_HEADER_DIRENT is now unnecessary:
    
         This macro is obsolescent, as all current systems with directory
         libraries have `dirent.h'.  New programs need not use this
         macro.
    
    This patch removes AC_HEADER_DIRENT and all checks for HAVE_DIRENT_H.
    It turned out that in most of the places where `dirent.h' was being
    #include'd it wasn't needed anyway.
    
    (Fix for a Cygwin build bug reported by Dan McMahill).

    build-sys: Improve HTML conversion rules.
    
    We want to make sure the HTML version of the man pages is always
    distributed, but make building/installing it optional (in case users
    don't have a proper groff installed).
    
    This can be achieved by making sure that Automake only tries to
    install the HTML man pages if a working groff is available.  In
    addition, `make distcheck' is set up to behave as if groff is not
    installed.
    
    Unfortunately, this still isn't ideal, because users who build from a
    source archive (with pre-built HTML) won't get HTML installed unless
    they have a working groff.
    
    In the long run, what needs to happen is to use a mechanism like
    `missing' to handle rebuilding of HTML man pages -- or just drop HTML
    man pages altogether.

    build-sys: Add check for groff html driver. [2836109]
    
    Some distributions, such as Ubuntu, do not install the groff HTML
    device by default, and an additional package must be installed to
    provide it. AX_PROG_GROFF therefore needs to check that groff is able
    to create HTML files.

    Makefile.am cleanup (removal of ChangeLog and Makefile.in files)
    
    Details on this commit:
    * Now that we are no longer storing machine generated ChangeLogs inside
      the git repository, make maintainer-clean should remove the machine
      generated ChangeLogs.  This way nobody accidently edits the ChangeLog.
      Only 7 ChangeLogs are left after a make maintainer-clean (intl, po,
      and one toplevel ChangeLog).
    * Some directories were missing the removal of Makefile.in when make
      maintainer-clean is run.  Only 3 Makefile.in files remain now after
      make maintainer-clean (only in the intl directories).
    * Removed $Id$ tags from some of the Makefiles since we are no longer
      using CVS.
    * Removed some unnecessary ChangeLogs from ever being created (from
      example/gTAG gschem/scripts, and symbol/font).
    
    Note 1: There are still some machine generated files still hanging around,
    but I'm going to leave those alone for now as the .gitignore mechanism
    properly masks those.
    
    Note 2: Made sure that all files that are to be removed in the *CLEANFILES
    lists comes before the #*# otherwise they will be ignored.

    include it.  Also libgeda/docs/images isn't integrated into the build
    properly yet, so it will not be in the distribution for now.

    what the script actually expects.
    
    - Make the use of temp files more secure.
    
    - Be more consistent about the usage of the build directory versus
      the source directory.
    
    - When a single test fails, just increment a failed count and continue on.
      Don't abort until all the tests have run.

    Fix autogen.sh scripts to look for AC_CONFIG_HEADER to run autoheader
    
    Since commit #9a7c363c572d32a30fa1522cd7d14b21c2958ca8, the configure
    scripts in gEDA use AC_CONFIG_HEADER, not AM_CONFIG_HEADER
    
    Fixes build problems noted by various users. Identified by Dan McMahill.

    We now require GTK+ 2.10.0, and since that requires GLib 2.12.0, we
    can bump the GLib version we require up to match.

    Require Guile 1.8.0 or newer.
    
    Guile 1.8 became the stable branch of Guile on 2006-02-12, over three
    *years* ago. All major distributions ship it, including Debian stable.
    
    Expecting its availability makes testing of new Scheme-based features
    much easier, as most gEDA developers normally write and test code
    against 1.8. Furthermore, it allows better advantage to be taken of
    1.8-only features (such as improvements in debugging support), without
    requiring vast swathes of hard-to-maintain preprocessor trickery.

    Write logs to $HOME/.gEDA/logs/.
    
    Rewrite s_log_init() to put log files in a centralised location. A
    user application (e.g. gnetlist) provides a prefix, and log file is
    opened at:
    
       $HOME/.gEDA/logs/<prefix>-<YYYYmmdd>-<serial>.log       [1]
    
    The serial is found by the following procedure:
    
    1. Read through the directory to find the highest existing <serial>.
    
    2. Starting with that number, repeatedly attempt to open()
       incrementing files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL flags to guarantee that a
       new file is created.
    
    3. If after LOG_OPEN_ATTEMPTS = 5 attempts a unique filename hasn't
       been found, fail.
    
    The logic *intentionally* does not fill in gaps in the sequence -- if
    I delete logs, I still want a new log to appear at the end of the
    list.
    
    [1] The actual location is a subdirectory "logs" of the user config
        directory, which may not be ~/.gEDA on all platforms.

    symbols when pulling in libgeda and its dependencies.

    pull in the appropriate CFLAGS and LIBS. This commit removes some
    LDFLAGS and LIBS from grenum, since they weren't being used.

    gsymcheck: checks for overbars and escaping
    
    Test for single overbar markers '\_label' and print a warning.
    libgeda currently closes an open overbar at the end of the string
    but a different implementation could drop the overbar.
    
    It also tests for single backslash characters. They will
    be invisible as a '\x' combination will only print the second
    char 'x'. The user should decide whether he likes to remove
    the backslash or whether to escape it and write '\\x'

    Revert applying -Werror to compiler flags when linking with GCC (CODE!!)
    
    Depending on the gcc version, the original developers might not see the
    warning until the software gets into the end user's hands (and tries
    building it with an older/newer version of gcc).  Most warnings are
    not catastropic, but by using -Werror they are _all_ catastropic.
    
    If a developer wants to get rid of all warnings, they should either:
    
     1) run make -s and see/fix all the warnings, and/or
     2) modify the Makefile's themselves and add the -Werror flag temporarily.
    
    (Comments explaining rationale snipped out of an email from Ales).

    gsymcheck: Don't export x_log_update_func, it is a libgeda symbol
    
    We set libgeda's exported x_log_update_func variable from
    gsymcheck.c. (This is declared as extern in libgeda's funcs.h)
    
    Move the logging function s_log_update() from globals.c (where
    it didn't belong) into its own file, s_log.c, making minor edits
    along the way. The log handler isn't called when "do_logging"
    is FALSE, so we don't need to test that from within the handler.

    attribute then print a warning with some text. The previous patch
    removed the error message, this one adds warning. Whether this
    situation is an error or not depends on the users intention.

    gsymcheck: improved pinnumber check
    
    The changes will check for duplicate pins in net definitions.
    It also checks the net definitions and the pinlabel definition
    seperatly, thus a power pin can have a pinlabel and a net pin.

    gsymcheck: moved obsolete and forbidden attribute checks
    
    This is a code cleanup patch, it moves the tests for obsolete and
    forbidden attributes to the symbol_structure test. Deleted the old
    check s_check_obsolete_forbidden_attributes() function and it's unused
    variables. In the output files, some format changes occured, but the
    meaning is still the same.

    added a check that contains all valid and five different case of
    invalid pintype values.
    Removed unused code in s_check_pintype() and added a function to
    check whether a string is in a list of strings.

    Removed misleading "pin count from footprint=" attribute check
    
    This check wasn't working correctly for all footprint= values.
    It probably worked fine for the DIP# and related footprints (ending
    with the number of pins in the footprin), but for others it was giving
    incorrect info/warnings.  This check will be replaced with something a
    little bit more flexible going forward in a later release.

    gsymcheck: added checks for offgrid pins
    
    The check prints an error message if the active end is offgrid and a
    warning message if the not active end is offgrid. The active end is
    detected with the whichend property.

    This patch actually *removes* error message output from file loading
    errors is some cases.  This is for the sake of keeping the patch
    concise, and will be addressed in later patches.

    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were

    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer

    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated copyright text/header in most source files.
    
    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.
