    Updated copyright text/header in most source files.
    
    Updated all copyright text dates that should be updated for the new year.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either
    GPL or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.

    build-sys: Don't use AC_HEADER_DIRENT.
    
    The Autoconf manual says that AC_HEADER_DIRENT is now unnecessary:
    
         This macro is obsolescent, as all current systems with directory
         libraries have `dirent.h'.  New programs need not use this
         macro.
    
    This patch removes AC_HEADER_DIRENT and all checks for HAVE_DIRENT_H.
    It turned out that in most of the places where `dirent.h' was being
    #include'd it wasn't needed anyway.
    
    (Fix for a Cygwin build bug reported by Dan McMahill).

    build-sys: Improve HTML conversion rules.
    
    We want to make sure the HTML version of the man pages is always
    distributed, but make building/installing it optional (in case users
    don't have a proper groff installed).
    
    This can be achieved by making sure that Automake only tries to
    install the HTML man pages if a working groff is available.  In
    addition, `make distcheck' is set up to behave as if groff is not
    installed.
    
    Unfortunately, this still isn't ideal, because users who build from a
    source archive (with pre-built HTML) won't get HTML installed unless
    they have a working groff.
    
    In the long run, what needs to happen is to use a mechanism like
    `missing' to handle rebuilding of HTML man pages -- or just drop HTML
    man pages altogether.

    build-sys: Add check for groff html driver. [2836109]
    
    Some distributions, such as Ubuntu, do not install the groff HTML
    device by default, and an additional package must be installed to
    provide it. AX_PROG_GROFF therefore needs to check that groff is able
    to create HTML files.

    More Makefile.am cleanup
    
    Details on this commit:
    * Removed even more trace of the old prototype mechanism from the Makefiles.
    * Removed the cleanup of configure scripts which are no longer there (or
      for that matter were never in the same directory as some of these
      Makefiles).
    * Removal of some files from the *CLEANFILES rules which never existed.
    * Line length tweaks and fixes

    Makefile.am cleanup (removal of ChangeLog and Makefile.in files)
    
    Details on this commit:
    * Now that we are no longer storing machine generated ChangeLogs inside
      the git repository, make maintainer-clean should remove the machine
      generated ChangeLogs.  This way nobody accidently edits the ChangeLog.
      Only 7 ChangeLogs are left after a make maintainer-clean (intl, po,
      and one toplevel ChangeLog).
    * Some directories were missing the removal of Makefile.in when make
      maintainer-clean is run.  Only 3 Makefile.in files remain now after
      make maintainer-clean (only in the intl directories).
    * Removed $Id$ tags from some of the Makefiles since we are no longer
      using CVS.
    * Removed some unnecessary ChangeLogs from ever being created (from
      example/gTAG gschem/scripts, and symbol/font).
    
    Note 1: There are still some machine generated files still hanging around,
    but I'm going to leave those alone for now as the .gitignore mechanism
    properly masks those.
    
    Note 2: Made sure that all files that are to be removed in the *CLEANFILES
    lists comes before the #*# otherwise they will be ignored.

    The old prototype.h creation mechanism hasn't been used in years and now
    has been fully removed.  Also removed common/outputs/Makefile.am since it
    no longer used either.

    The only file which I might want to not distribute is update-version.sh,
    which technically is a developer/maintainer only file, but for now I'll
    include it.  Also libgeda/docs/images isn't integrated into the build
    properly yet, so it will not be in the distribution for now.

    Reduce stderr spew.
    
    It's not necessary to spew massive amounts of output to stderr on
    startup. It's ugly and not legally necessary.
    
    This patch modifies the tools only to spew a GPL header to stderr when
    entering gnetlist's interactive mode -- and to be nice and quiet the rest of
    the time.

    Fix several minor bugs in the testsuite.
    
    - Make the list of arguments passed into the runtest.sh script match
    what the script actually expects.
    
    - Make the use of temp files more secure.
    
    - Be more consistent about the usage of the build directory versus
      the source directory.
    
    - When a single test fails, just increment a failed count and continue on.
      Don't abort until all the tests have run.

    Require Guile 1.8.0 or newer.
    
    Guile 1.8 became the stable branch of Guile on 2006-02-12, over three
    *years* ago. All major distributions ship it, including Debian stable.
    
    Expecting its availability makes testing of new Scheme-based features
    much easier, as most gEDA developers normally write and test code
    against 1.8. Furthermore, it allows better advantage to be taken of
    1.8-only features (such as improvements in debugging support), without
    requiring vast swathes of hard-to-maintain preprocessor trickery.

    Write logs to $HOME/.gEDA/logs/.
    
    Rewrite s_log_init() to put log files in a centralised location. A
    user application (e.g. gnetlist) provides a prefix, and log file is
    opened at:
    
       $HOME/.gEDA/logs/<prefix>-<YYYYmmdd>-<serial>.log       [1]
    
    The serial is found by the following procedure:
    
    1. Read through the directory to find the highest existing <serial>.
    
    2. Starting with that number, repeatedly attempt to open()
       incrementing files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL flags to guarantee that a
       new file is created.
    
    3. If after LOG_OPEN_ATTEMPTS = 5 attempts a unique filename hasn't
       been found, fail.
    
    The logic *intentionally* does not fill in gaps in the sequence -- if
    I delete logs, I still want a new log to appear at the end of the
    list.
    
    [1] The actual location is a subdirectory "logs" of the user config
        directory, which may not be ~/.gEDA on all platforms.

    gsymcheck: checks for overbars and escaping
    
    Test for single overbar markers '\_label' and print a warning.
    libgeda currently closes an open overbar at the end of the string
    but a different implementation could drop the overbar.
    
    It also tests for single backslash characters. They will
    be invisible as a '\x' combination will only print the second
    char 'x'. The user should decide whether he likes to remove
    the backslash or whether to escape it and write '\\x'

    libgeda: Remove non-private access of PAGE->object_list
    
    This allows us to keep better track of where the PAGE must be updated
    should we have any spatially keyed data-structures in the future.
    
    Rename PAGE->object_list PAGE->_object_list to try and discorage any
    use of it outside libgeda (ideally, outside s_page.c) in the future.

    These GLists themselves are not (and shouldn't be) modified, although
    the OBJECTs they point at may well be.

    gsymcheck: warning message if show_name_value is weird [#2470862]
    
    If a text object is not an attribute the show_name_value field
    of the text object should be SHOW_NAME_VALUE.
    
    Create a warning if it's SHOW_NAME or SHOW_VALUE. It's not really
    an error, thus only create a warning

    This affords quite a lot of code clean-up, since we no longer have to
    maintain two versions of each operation which works on lists.

    Revert applying -Werror to compiler flags when linking with GCC (CODE!!)
    
    Depending on the gcc version, the original developers might not see the
    warning until the software gets into the end user's hands (and tries
    building it with an older/newer version of gcc).  Most warnings are
    not catastropic, but by using -Werror they are _all_ catastropic.
    
    If a developer wants to get rid of all warnings, they should either:
    
     1) run make -s and see/fix all the warnings, and/or
     2) modify the Makefile's themselves and add the -Werror flag temporarily.
    
    (Comments explaining rationale snipped out of an email from Ales).

    gsymcheck: Don't export x_log_update_func, it is a libgeda symbol
    
    We set libgeda's exported x_log_update_func variable from
    gsymcheck.c. (This is declared as extern in libgeda's funcs.h)
    
    Move the logging function s_log_update() from globals.c (where
    it didn't belong) into its own file, s_log.c, making minor edits
    along the way. The log handler isn't called when "do_logging"
    is FALSE, so we don't need to test that from within the handler.

    Draw func cleanup.
    
    Rather than having libgeda require other applications to provide the
    *_draw_func symbols, libgeda should provide them itself. Other
    applications should then override them as required near their call to
    libgeda_init().

    If a number is in a net attribute and a value of any pinlabel
    attribute then print a warning with some text. The previous patch
    removed the error message, this one adds warning. Whether this
    situation is an error or not depends on the users intention.

    It also checks the net definitions and the pinlabel definition
    seperatly, thus a power pin can have a pinlabel and a net pin.

    This is a code cleanup patch, it moves the tests for obsolete and
    forbidden attributes to the symbol_structure test. Deleted the old

    variables. In the output files, some format changes occured, but the
    meaning is still the same.

    Removed misleading "pin count from footprint=" attribute check
    
    This check wasn't working correctly for all footprint= values.
    It probably worked fine for the DIP# and related footprints (ending
    with the number of pins in the footprin), but for others it was giving
    incorrect info/warnings.  This check will be replaced with something a
    little bit more flexible going forward in a later release.

    errors is some cases.  This is for the sake of keeping the patch
    concise, and will be addressed in later patches.

    Replace index and rindex by strchr and strrchr.
    
    These are functionally equivalent, and more portable to MinGW.

    Avoid accessing (GList)->{next|priv} directly to aid debugging.
    
    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    Moved 3 rc promotion keywords from gschem into libgeda (fix for bug#1748143)
    
    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    Alter guile 1.6 compat tests to work with older autoconf versions
    
    Don't use AC_DEFINE to define function like macros, instead use
    AC_CHECK_DECLS to set a HAVE_DECL_..., then use AH_VERBATIM to
    insert a test which defines a replacement if necessary.

    Removed AM_MAINTAINER_MODE from all configure.ac[.in] files.
    
    Maintainer mode is no longer needed or desired now that we are no longer
    using CVS.  Hopefully this will prevent some of the odd problems that were
    observed during the last release when the Makefile's didn't get auto
    regenerated.

    Changed gEDA/gaf's version mechanism to use new dotted X.Y.Z convention
    
    Added DOTTED_VERSION and DATE_VERSION variables to all configure.ac[.in]
    files.  Changed all version related output to be DOTTED_VERSION.DATE_VERSION.
    Updated the configure.ac[.in] files to have consistent top sections.
    Updated code and various scheme files to use the new DOTTED_VERSION
    and DATE_VERSION variables available via config.h.  Stopped using
    PREPEND_VERSION_STRING as the mechanism for doing the dotted versions
    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Updated all copyright text dates that have my name (Ales) associated
    with them.  Added gEDA contributer copyright text where appropriate.
    Fixed a bunch of GNU text typos (these should have been either GPL
    or gEDA).  Removed some $Id$ tags which are no longer used/needed.
    Fixed a few file header that were just plain incorrect.
