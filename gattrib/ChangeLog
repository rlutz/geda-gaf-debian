    Add GIO compiler/linker options
    
    libgeda uses the GFile API which means all gEDA/gaf binaries must be
    linked against libgio-2.0.  This appears to be inferred automatically
    on most systems, but sometimes it needs to be explicitly specified.

    gattrib: Suppress compilation warnings
    
    These warnings don't appear to indicate actual problems.  Since I
    don't want to change gtksheet_2_2.c, just mask the warnings.
    
    This suppresses the following compilation warnings:
    gattrib/src/gtksheet_2_2.c:104:21: warning: unused function
        'DEFAULT_FONT_ASCENT' [-Wunused-function]
    gattrib/src/gtksheet_2_2.c: In function 'gtk_sheet_range_draw':

        not guard... [-Wmisleading-indentation]
    gattrib/src/gtksheet_2_2.c:3394:3: note: ...this statement, but the
        latter is misleadingly indented as if it is guarded by the 'for'

    Fix `make doxygen' for VPATH builds

    build: Generate an empty ChangeLog when git history unavailable
    
    When no git history is available -- for example, when the git
    repository was cloned using the `--depth` option to limit the amount
    of git history downloaded -- the changelog-generation rule can fail
    because the changelog's base git commit (i.e. the 1.0 release tag)
    isn't available in the repository.
    
    This patch makes generation of `ChangeLog` succeed in that situation,
    by creating an empty log and printing a warning to stderr.  It allows
    `make dist` and `make distcheck` to pass on shallow clones.

    libgeda: remove unused parameter from o_text_new

    Remove uses of deprecated g_strcasecmp().
    
    The deprecated GLib function `g_strcasecmp()` is used very rarely in
    the engine, and in exactly two places:
    
    * Checking the version from an rc file: in this case, we can ensure
      that the compiled-in `PACKAGE_DATE_VERSION` string is ASCII and
      safely use `g_ascii_strcasecmp()`.
    
    * Checking whether a page has a particular filename in
      `s_page_search()`.  For most of the platforms we support, the
      filesystem is case-insensitive, so it may well be possible to have a
      `FOO.sch` and `foo.sch` open at the same time.  For now, replace the
      filesystem comparion with a straightforward `strcmp()` call.

    gattrib: Make "Add new attribute column" actually insert column.
    
    I first saw bug 698608, which seems to be a duplicate of this bug, and
    came up with a patch that corrects the behavior and inserts the empty
    data column under the right column heading. The problem was that the
    header gets alphabetically sorted into the others (after device,
    footprint, and value) but the code immediately following that inserts
    the new column after the last column, which seems to be making the
    assumption that the headers do not get sorted.
    
    My patch adds a new s_string_list function
    (s_string_list_find_in_list()) that searches for a given string in the
    list and returns the index (or -1, if it's not there), unlike the
    existing function (s_string_list_in_list()) (that I copied from but
    didn't touch) which just returns 1 as soon as it finds a matching
    string, or 0, if it's not there. I then added code in
    s_toplevel_add_new_attrib() that uses the new function to determine
    where the new column header was placed and insert the new data column
    at that index (instead of at the end).

    gattrib: gtksheet cleanups.
    
    I compiled using the compiler option -DGTK_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES
    
    This option looks for needless extra included gtk and gdk headers. The
    only place was gattrib/src/gtksheet_2_2.c where I fixed the includes
    and looked for unused but maybe assigned variables, which I removed.
    
    Minor code cleanup in this file.

    gattrib: Preserve visibility of embedded component attributes
    
    gattrib was overriding the visibility of pin attributes to match the
    visibility of the pin. This was not noticed for non-embedded complex
    objects, as the edited pin attributes are not saved. For embedded
    components, they are.

    Remove OBJECT->sel_func in favour of an OBJECT->selectable flag
    
    Only gschem called OBJECT->sel_func anyway, so lets avoid passing vfunc
    pointers everywhere as a flag. This has the added benefit of removing
    some dummy functions from gattrib and gschlas which were only present
    so the status of locked objects could be preserved across load/save.

    Print message and exit if rc file load fails.
    
    Modifies g_rc_parse() to print useful messages to standard error and
    exit with non-zero status if an error other than ENOENT occurs while
    attempting to parse any configuration file.
    
    N.b. only copes with rc files loaded at startup; rc files loaded later
    (e.g. a gafrc auto-loaded while loading a schematic using gschem
    "File->Open") can't cause the application to die.
    
    Since this means that under some circumstances gschem and gattrib can
    appear to do nothing silently (e.g. when launched from via a .desktop
    file) subsequent patches need to make gschem and gattrib generate
    appropriate warning and/or error message dialogs.

    Manually merge translations from the stable-1.6 branch
    
    For newly translated languages, this was fairly simple, using msgmerge
    to update the stable-1.6 "$LANG.po" files with the current git HEAD
    translation template ".pot" files.
    
    For existing languages, I used msgcat to combine the two, allowing it
    to choose the "newer" translation - ie.. the one on the stable-1.6
    branch if there were any conflicts.
    
    To assist, I used the following short script:
    
    \#!/bin/sh
    
    LINGUAS=`cat LINGUAS`
    TEMPLATE="geda-gschem.pot"
    NEW_DIR="stable-1.6"
    OLD_DIR="HEAD"
    
    for TR_LANG in $LINGUAS
    do
      echo "Attempting to merge for language ${TR_LANG}"
      if [ -e ${OLD_DIR}/${TR_LANG}.po ]; then
        echo -n "Old translation exists.. merging"
        msgcat --use-first ${NEW_DIR}/${TR_LANG}.po ${OLD_DIR}/${TR_LANG}.po -o merge_tmp.po

    new languages before it is run.

    massively broken happened during the merge, and committed as a merge
    to show the origin of the translations.

    Some of the translatable strings in the source code contain UTF-8
    encoded characters.  Without setting the --from-code argument
    appropriately, xgettext chokes on these strings, which can result in
    an infinitely-recursing build.

    gattrib: Remove bit rotten GtkItemEntry widget implementation
    
    This fixes gattrib with Gtk > 2.16.x
    
    The old gtkitementry_2_2.c code subclassed GtkEntry, and (ab)used its
    private implementation. The implementation of GtkEntry changed in 2.18 to
    allow a model / view architecture, breaking this code (and thus gattrib).
    
    Since we didn't use any of the extra features the GtkItemEntry subclass
    provided, we can simply drop this code and use plain GtkEntry widgets in
    gattrib.
    
    Remove the configure test which requires gattrib to be disabled when
    building against later gtk versions.

    build-sys: Check and set Windows-specific flags.
    
    The Windows platform has a native gcc port (MinGW) and a
    POSIX compliant one (Cygwin). Both need specific flags to
    build correctly.
    
    The rules are:
    
    * On all Windows platforms, pass -no-undefined to libtool.
      This allows shared libraries (DLLs) to be built.
    
    * On MinGW, use the -mms-bitfields compiler flag.
      This increases compatibility with the MSVC compiler.
    
    * On MinGW, pass -mwindows when linking GUI-only applications.
      This avoids opening a text console when running from a shortcut.

    Popping up a dialog for unimplemented features stops the user being
    able to identify what parts of the program are supposed to work.
    
    Due to internal data-structures not being cleared out, opening new
    files is not a trivial feature to implement cleanly.
    
    Remove the non-working menu option for now.
    
    Users must select the files they wish to work with as command line
    arguments, or in the file-chooser dialog offered when the program
    starts.

    build-sys: Don't use AC_HEADER_DIRENT.
    
    The Autoconf manual says that AC_HEADER_DIRENT is now unnecessary:
    
         This macro is obsolescent, as all current systems with directory
         libraries have `dirent.h'.  New programs need not use this
         macro.
    
    This patch removes AC_HEADER_DIRENT and all checks for HAVE_DIRENT_H.
    It turned out that in most of the places where `dirent.h' was being
    #include'd it wasn't needed anyway.
    
    (Fix for a Cygwin build bug reported by Dan McMahill).

    Makefile.am cleanup (removal of ChangeLog and Makefile.in files)
    
    Details on this commit:
    * Now that we are no longer storing machine generated ChangeLogs inside
      the git repository, make maintainer-clean should remove the machine
      generated ChangeLogs.  This way nobody accidently edits the ChangeLog.
      Only 7 ChangeLogs are left after a make maintainer-clean (intl, po,
      and one toplevel ChangeLog).
    * Some directories were missing the removal of Makefile.in when make
      maintainer-clean is run.  Only 3 Makefile.in files remain now after
      make maintainer-clean (only in the intl directories).
    * Removed $Id$ tags from some of the Makefiles since we are no longer
      using CVS.
    * Removed some unnecessary ChangeLogs from ever being created (from
      example/gTAG gschem/scripts, and symbol/font).
    
    Note 1: There are still some machine generated files still hanging around,
    but I'm going to leave those alone for now as the .gitignore mechanism
    properly masks those.
    
    Note 2: Made sure that all files that are to be removed in the *CLEANFILES
    lists comes before the #*# otherwise they will be ignored.

    Restructuring of build system, including new m4 macros and helper
    programs. Note: only libgeda can be built from this commit.
    
    Important differences from previous versions:
    
     - The tarball is now called gEDA-<version>.tar.gz.
    
     - Documentation is now installed to ${docdir}
    
     - A `version.h' file is generated containing the package version
       strings, including the git commit SHA-1 and the descriptive string
       from `git describe'.  `version.h' is distributed in the source
       tarball so that gEDA can be built without git.

    gattrib: many doxygen comment improvements
    
    - Cleaned up brief descriptions for functions and added full
      descriptions, parameter descriptions and return values for the
      functions in gattrib.c
    - Added a mainpage for doxygen, including SDB's notes from the comment
      block in the file itself, plus the notes from the mailing list
      message SDB sent to Ivan when he was intending to work on gattrib
    - Made a lot of doxygen improvements in parsecmd.c. All functions
      documented plus the OPTIONS defined.
    - Doxygen commenting in s_sheet_data.c Documented the s_sheet_new()
      function and the file itself in s_sheet_data.c.
    - Added file block to parsecmd.c, remove redundant
      argument to file command in s_sheet_data.c and s_string_list.c
    - Added Doxygen comments for the st_string_list struct.
    - doxygen commeted listsort.c, Added doxygen link from main() to
      gattrib_main(). Added the brackets required by doxygen in the
      comment for main() to allow it to automatically link to the
      documentation for the gattrib_main() function. Added a note to
      listsort.c expressing my desire to merge it into
      s_string_list.c. Also noted that it might use some optimisation for
      STRING_LIST specifics.
    - doxygen comments for s_toplevel.c. Added doxygen comments for
      globals.h, prototype.h, g_rc.c, g_register.c and i_basic.c. Added
      doxygen comments to i_vars.h, i_vars.c, s_attrib.c, s_misc.c and
      s_object.c. Added doxygen comments to s_rename.c and s_table.c
    - Added doxygen comments to s_visibility.c,
      x_dialog.c and x_fileselect.c.
    - Added more doxygen commenting to x_gtksheet.c Added doxygen comments
      to x_window.c Noted in the doxygen commentary for s_string_list that
      the structures in that file would be equally well served by a GList
      structure, which would allow the use of the glib sort and search
      routines, instead of the homebrew ones in this file.  Added the
      correct tagging to struct.h to push the comments into the doxygen
      output.  Improved doxygen comments in s_table.c

    Guile 1.8 became the stable branch of Guile on 2006-02-12, over three
    *years* ago. All major distributions ship it, including Debian stable.
    
    Expecting its availability makes testing of new Scheme-based features
    much easier, as most gEDA developers normally write and test code
    against 1.8. Furthermore, it allows better advantage to be taken of
    1.8-only features (such as improvements in debugging support), without
    requiring vast swathes of hard-to-maintain preprocessor trickery.

    gattrib: Focus the "save" button in the close confirmation dialog
    
    For safety, "Close without saving" should not be the default action.
    Looking at other GTK (and GNOME) applications, the default action used
    seems to be "Save" (this is what the user will probably want to choose).

    Rename the old function as exported API o_attrib_string_get_name_value(),
    so existing code (such as validating potential attribute strings) can
    still work unaltered.
    
    The new o_attrib_get_name_value() wraps o_attrib_string_get_name_value().

Author: Peter TB Brett <peter@peter-b.co.uk>
Date:   Wed Jan 21 14:11:39 2009 +0000

    Write logs to $HOME/.gEDA/logs/.
    
    Rewrite s_log_init() to put log files in a centralised location. A
    user application (e.g. gnetlist) provides a prefix, and log file is
    opened at:
    
       $HOME/.gEDA/logs/<prefix>-<YYYYmmdd>-<serial>.log       [1]
    
    The serial is found by the following procedure:
    
    1. Read through the directory to find the highest existing <serial>.
    
    2. Starting with that number, repeatedly attempt to open()
       incrementing files with O_CREAT|O_EXCL flags to guarantee that a
       new file is created.
    
    3. If after LOG_OPEN_ATTEMPTS = 5 attempts a unique filename hasn't
       been found, fail.
    
    The logic *intentionally* does not fill in gaps in the sequence -- if
    I delete logs, I still want a new log to appear at the end of the
    list.
    
    [1] The actual location is a subdirectory "logs" of the user config
        directory, which may not be ~/.gEDA on all platforms.

    Refactor finding paths for config etc.
    
    This is intended to provide a centralised place for determining the
    paths more "smartly" in the future (e.g. for platforms with different
    conventions on where config should go).
    
    Only user-visible change should be that log messages when loading
    config files no longer hardcode "~/.gEDA".

    symbols when pulling in libgeda and its dependencies.
    
    Fix applications using GLib and guile within the suite to explicitly
    pull in the appropriate CFLAGS and LIBS. This commit removes some
    LDFLAGS and LIBS from grenum, since they weren't being used.

    Remove GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL and TOPLEVEL indirection for fixed colour indices
    
    Colour indices such as grid_colour and select_color are not changed at
    run-time since (by definition) those graphic elements are always drawn
    with the sepcified index. Remove the indirection through GSCHEM_TOPLEVEL
    or TOPLEVEL, and use the appropriate index constant instead.
    
    The background_color indirection remains, since swapping this is used
    to override the background to white when exporting black and white image.

    Fix attribute colours for embedded objects [#2157598]
    
    Add an argument, "set_color" to o_attrib_attach[_list]() to specify
    whether the colour of the attribute should be reset to the default
    attribute colour when performing the attachment.
    
    We set this to true when promoting toplevel unattached attributes
    inside a symbol onto the schematic page, when the user explicitly
    attaches an attribute inside gschem. It is FALSE in other cases.
    
    In cases where we're creating new attributes, such as o_slot_end(),
    we specify the attribute colour we want to o_text_new().
    
    Remove colour setting from o_attrib_add(), since there is no point
    having this code in two places. o_attrib_add() just deals with the
    datastructures now.

    gattrib: Fix crash when removing attributes from multiple files.
    
    We were iterating over a list which could have objects removed from it.
    Since this is dangerous, iterate over a copy of the list. Since
    attributes come later in the object list than the objects they are
    attached to, iterating the list backwards means we don't
    encounter objects we've already free'd.
    
    We also need to set TOPLEVEL->page_current to the page we're working on,
    since within the loop, this variable is used to find which linked list
    to remove the objects from.

    It was noted that special-casing the "graphical" attribute could cause
    gattrib to crash on save (Bug #2214739).
    
    There is no real reason why the user might not want to edit a graphical

    gattrib, gschlas: Restore setting dummy select_func to ensure proper save
    
    The select_func function pointer (now owned and exported by libgeda) is
    assigned to OBJECT->sel_func for non-locked objects. Locking is achieved
    by setting OBJECT->sel_func to NULL, and when writing out objects, the
    locked flag is determined by comparing that that pointer to NULL.
    
    We need to keep providing a dummy function so we can differentiate
    between that and a NULL pointer. This was accidentally lost in
    commit 1aab94354f053887db67aa5702abc595795dfe82 which moved the
    select_func global variable into libgeda.

    Revert applying -Werror to compiler flags when linking with GCC (CODE!!)
    
    Depending on the gcc version, the original developers might not see the
    warning until the software gets into the end user's hands (and tries
    building it with an older/newer version of gcc).  Most warnings are
    not catastropic, but by using -Werror they are _all_ catastropic.
    
    If a developer wants to get rid of all warnings, they should either:
    
     1) run make -s and see/fix all the warnings, and/or

    Use pkg-config support for Guile if present.
    
    Using pkg-config allows easier cross-compilation, since the build
    process can use a pkg-config binary native to the build machine with .pc
    files for the host machine.

    gattrib: Fix more non-literal format strings which cause compiler warnings.
    
    We should be careful to avoid passing arbitrary strings into functions
    which take printf style arguments. In that case, always use the construct
    ("%s", string) rather than passing string as the format argument.
    
    Admittedly, some of the cases fixed were fine anyway, as the string passed
    was a known constant. In any case, less noise from the compiler leads to
    easier spotting of real problems.

          Use o_attrib_get_name_value() to parse attribute strings in gattrib.
    
          Replaced u_basic_breakup_string() with o_attrib_get_name_value() in
          gattrib when splitting attribute string for name and/or value.
    
    This commit introduced a crash saving certain schematics.
    
    It appears to be caused because gattrib uses invalid attribute strings
    such as "attrib_name=" to mark objects which do not have a particular
    attribute present (or that it was deleted during editing).
    
    Since o_attrib_get_name_value() can only processes valid attribute
    strings, it is useless for parsing strings such as these.
    
    Since it isn't immediately clear how many of the o_attrib_get_name_value()
    calls introduced in the above commit are affected by this
    (specifically, where in gattrib these invalid strings are encountered),
    I'm reverting the whole patch rather than trying to build a fix on top.

    gattrib: Attempt to make sheet changed detection less sensitive. (CODE!*)
    
    * Really now.. this is getting embarassing.
    
    The old code set the page's CHANGED flag upon received keypresses,
    including modifier-keys such as Alt etc.. (As used to access the
    common Alt+F4 shortcut to close the window), meaning the user was
    always prompted that they would loose changes.
    
    Remove setting the CHANGED flag in functions gtk_entry_enter_text
    and gtk_sheet_key_press. Instead, set it in gtk_sheet_entry_changed
    and gtk_sheet_real_cell_clear.
    
    This code could do with some closer attention in the future. There
    are certainly more appropriate places to set the CHANGED flag,
    ie. without hacking the gtksheet implementation to do it directly.

    Rename translations to drop un-needed ISO-3166 country codes.
    
    From Debian bug #336796:
    
    Using a country part in a translation file is a discouraged practice
    except in very few cases (such as pt_BR).
    
    Using a fr_FR.po file instead of a fr.po file prevents users of fr_CA,
    fr_BE, fr_LU, fr_CH and all other existing and future locales for
    French to benefit from the French translation of the program.
    
    In general PO files should only be named after the
    ISO_639 code of the given language and should not use a country part
    with a ISO-3166 code. The only accepted expcetions to this are:
    
    -pt_BR for Brazilian Portuguese and pt alone for "standard Portuguese"
    -zh_CN for "Simplified Chinese" use in mailand China and Singapore
    -zh_TW for "Traditional Chinese" used in Taiwan

    gattrib was hardcoding the path to gattrib-menus.xml (using GEDADATADIR
    which is set at configure time).  This patch makes it possible to move
    the gattrib binary to a different prefix.  If GEDADATA is not set, then
    the original behavior of using GEDADATADIR to find gattrib-menus.xml is
    used.

    gattrib: Set default window icon to "gattrib" from the icon theme.
    
    When a "gattrib" icon is found in the icon theme, this will be used as the
    default application icon. For GTK versions < 2.6, some default sizes have
    been picked at which to look for icons. GTK >= 2.6 will find the best icon
    by name.

    Remove the ATTRIB linked list in favour of a GList
    
    The ATTRIB.copied_to pointer is moved from the ATTRIB struct to reside in
    the source OBJECT being copied.
    
    The ATTRIB *attached_to pointer of an attribute's text OBJECT is changed
    to OBJECT *attached_to, pointing directly at the OBJECT to which that
    attribute is attached. This avoids the need to traverse the ATTRIB list
    and retrieve this pointer from the HEAD attribute node. (A HEAD node is
    not used in the GList of ATTRIBs).
    
    The ATTRIB structure now only contains one element, OBJECT *object. This
    points to the text OBJECT holding and displaying that attribute's
    "name=value".

    Instead use g_list_{next|previous}, allowing us to catch errors where
    changing from gEDA structures which had their own next and prev pointers.
    
    To debug, edit the glist.h include file from glib, renaming the next and
    prev elements in the GList structure and macros. Recompile gEDA to see any
    bad accesses such as those where the HEAD nodes were previously skipped.

    This is a fix for (Patch#) 1789290 libgeda-1.2.0 fprintf which supplied a
    similar patch which fixes the issues in libgeda/src/s_clib.c and
    libgeda/src/s_textbuffer.c.  In the future, all releases will be built with
    gtk+ 2.4.x so that these sorts of problems do not get released.

    Remove the globally exported variable_set_func.
    
    Only gattrib provided a non-NULL export of this symbol, and such imports
    into libgeda prevent libgeda being dynamically linked on some platforms.
    
    To better match the other tools in the suite, gattrib's i_vars_set() and
    i_window_vars_set() functions were combined into a single i_vars_set().

    All the promotion keywords were moved from gschem into libgeda to fix:
    [ 1748143 ] gschlas causes duplicate prompted attributes   The primary
    cause of this bug was that the promotion variables within TOPLEVEL were
    not being setup by gschlas and so duplicate refdes attributes were
    showing up in the schematic.  The three rc keywords that were moved are:
    
    (attribute-promotion ... )
    (promote-invisible ... )
    (keep-invisible ... )

    (not intended for that use).  Updated update-versions.sh script to set the
    version in all the configure.ac[.in] files and the toplevel Makefile.
    Went through all the g_rc.c files and make the handling of rc file
    mismatch handling consistent.

    Changed/updated the #define mechanism for creating custom gEDA/gaf versions.
    
    Previously this mechanism was used to create custom versions of gEDA/gaf.
    With the coming of stable and development versions of gEDA/gaf, this
    mechanism was changed so that end users can tell the difference between
    a stable release vs a development release (by looking at the version string).
    The CUSTOM_VERSION #define was changed PREPEND_VERSION_STRING and is now
    prepended to any strings that output the VERSION string.

    Changes to ChangeLog usage.
    
    With actual changes this time.  Old-style changelogs as of gaf 1.0
    (release of 26th June 2007) are moved to ChangeLog-1.0; new (blank)
    ChangeLogs replace them.  A script has been added to the gaf top level
    to allow maintainers to update all the ChangeLog files immediately
    prior to making out a release.

    Avoid writting '\r' to files on MinGW.
    
    Applied patch #1733826 from Cesar Strauss. Thanks.
    When using the "w" mode in fopen, MinGW translates LF into CR-LF.
    This creates havoc when reading the same file again, when sharing
    schematics files with other systems, and when placing them in a VCS.
    
    This can be avoided by using the "wb" mode. The "b" is ignored on
    all POSIX conforming systems, according to these sources:
    
    http://www.die.net/doc/linux/man/man3/fopen.3.html
    http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/functions/fopen.html
    
    There are other ways, however. Adding
    
    #include <fcntl.h>
    int _fmode = _O_BINARY;
    
    on some source file should work as well. Another way is linking
    against the MinGW supplied binmode.o, which does exactly that.

    Added call to g_thread_init() in Gschem and Gattrib.
    
    Gschem and Gattrib aren't threaded, but some of GTK's file chooser
    backends uses threading so we need to call g_thread_init().
